Trekking holiday with home-stays, the Spiti valley

14 days

The breathtaking scenery of the Spiti Valley and the experience of staying in home-stays

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
This trekking holiday with home-stays, in the remote Spiti Valley gives you the chance to experience first hand a Buddhist way of life that has remained unchanged for centuries. You will interact closely with the local people as they go about the daily tasks of farming, water management and cooking. Some of the world’s most endangered species make their home in the Spiti valley and you may be lucky enough to encounter a Snow Leopard, a Tibetan Wolf or a Blue Sheep.

The valleys of Spiti and Lahaul are bound by Tibet in the east, the Kullu valley to the south and Ladakh in the north. While in some ways these wild valleys are similar to the Leh and Zanskar valleys of Ladakh, they are more remote, mysterious and magnificent. Because of deep snow and subzero temperatures road access to the region is impossible for most of the year. This land lies between altitudes of 3000m and 6000m. At lower altitudes we find wide valleys with rich pastures full of wild flowers. These contrast with soaring peaks and frozen glaciers. It is one of the most impressive and remote areas for trekking in India.
