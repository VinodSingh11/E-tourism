kauri pass

For many people the highlight of trekking in India is the way of life and the character of the mountain people we meet along the way.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
This trekking holiday in India over the Kauri Pass (3840m) offers some of the most amazing views of the Greater Himalayan Range. When you reach the pass you are rewarded by an impressive panoramic view. As we look south we see the lower alpine hills rolling away towards the great plains of the Indian Sub-Continent fed by the river Ganges. To the north are the gorges of Trushul, and to the east we see the Garhwal Himalayas with Kedarnath Peak and Kedarnath Dome, almost 7000 metres high. Our eyes are then drawn westwards then to the sweeping arc created by the incredible line up of giant peaks: Chaukhamba (7140 m), Nilkantha (6597 m), Kamet (07756 m), Gauri Parbat(6727 m), Nanda Devi(7817 m), Bethartoli(6352 m), and Dunagiri (7066 m). En route to the Pass we trek through isolated settlements and wild flower pastures, passing numerous snow fed waterfalls and streams.
