Tiger Safari, Ranthambhore National Park
5 day trip


DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
Ranthambhore is the only dry deciduous tiger habitat in India, making it one of the best places in the world to see tigers in their natural environment. In other reserves one has to penetrate thick jungle cover to see the big cat. Ranthambhore has great wildlife stocks: among the cats are caracal, jungle cat, rusty spotted cat and leopard. Other mammals include striped hyena, Indian fox, spotted deer, Indian gazelle, blue bull, wild boar, sloth bear and jackal. There are about 35 species of reptile, including crocodile and over 300 bird species.

Adding to the wildlife is the exceptional scenery of the park, the highlight being the impressive Mughal fort from the 10th Century. There are also crumbling ruins of temples and mosques all over the reserve. You will stay in luxurious en suite raj-style tents, reminiscent of the glory days of the British Raj at the Ranthambhlore Bagh, where you will enjoy sumptuous food, traditional dance and great staff.
