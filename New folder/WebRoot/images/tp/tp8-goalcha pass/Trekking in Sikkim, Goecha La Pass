15 days trip

A moderate trek over the Goecha La Pass. Amazing views of the Himalayas, Buddhist culture, Darjeeling tea estates.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
While the mountaineers of the world may revere Khangchendzonga (8589 m) as the world's third highest peak,for the people of the region it is much more than that.It is the home of Sikkim's patron deity. Sikkim, surrounded by Nepal in the west,Tibet to the north,Bhutan in the east and the Ganges river delta to the south is one of the most impressive areas for trekking in India.It is also an area less travelled as trekking in Sikkim for foreign tourists has only been permitted since 2000.

While on this trekking holiday we stay close to the looming peak of Khangchendzonga. On the route we pass through woodlands of rhododendron, pine and magnolia and continue up to the alpine pastures used for summer grazing by the yak herds of the nomadic Lepcha people.
