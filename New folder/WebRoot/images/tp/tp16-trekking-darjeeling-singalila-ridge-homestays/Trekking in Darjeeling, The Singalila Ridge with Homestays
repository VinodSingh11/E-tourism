DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
This is a trekking holiday with a difference. Staying in home-stays is one of the best ways to experience the unique culture of the Indian Himalayas. Get back to basics and learn how these mountain people cook, sleep, farm and go about their day to day lives.

The views of the Greater Himalayan Range from the Ridge especially at Phalut and Sandakphu are considered by many as the best in the world. From east to west the peaks of Nepal, Sikkim, Tibet and Bhutan line up in a amazing panoramic arc.

On this adventure we visit beautiful villages and monasteries as well as hiking through lush forests and open meadows frequented by grazing yaks.
